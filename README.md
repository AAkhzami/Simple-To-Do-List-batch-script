# 📝 Simple To-Do Manager  
*A beginner-friendly Batch File task manager*

---

## 📌 About the Project
**Simple To-Do Manager** is a small command-line application built entirely using  
**Windows Batch File (.bat)**.  
The project was created to help me practice Batch scripting and understand how  
menus, file handling, and simple text-based data structures work.

This application lets you manage tasks using a straightforward interface inside CMD.  
It supports adding tasks, viewing them, deleting specific ones, clearing the entire list,  
and even editing any task through a structured update menu.

This project is beginner-friendly and great for learning how Batch logic works.

## 💻 How It Works

The program uses a text-based menu that allows you to:

1. Add a new task
2. View all saved tasks
3. Delete a task by number
4. Edit any task (title, description, or difficulty)
5. Clear all tasks
6. Customize theme and font colors

The application rebuilds the entire task file when deleting or updating tasks.
This ensures the tasks remain clean and in the correct order.
